Problem statement--

        Program: Write a Java program to create a class called "Hospital" with instance variables "patients" (a list of Patient objects) and "numPatients" (the number of patients in the list). Include the following methods:
        A method to add a patient to the list
        A method to remove a patient from the list
        A method to search for a patient by their ID
        A method to sort the patients in the list by their age (ascending or descending order)
        A method to calculate the average age of all patients
        A method to print the details of all patients in the hospital

        Concepts used-
        i have done it without using any inbuilt methods. Code is in logical concepts.i have implemented OOPS concepts here like
        Inheritance is used.
        Stram Api
        Encapsulation is used.
